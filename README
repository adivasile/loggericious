Loggericious
===========

Small little plugin I made to format my log output, so I can better understand what it's saying.
It adds a timestamp, coloring and indentation.
It also adds a new method called +taste+. This will automatically call +.inspect+ on what you
are trying to print in the log.



Example
=======

Rails.logger.taste @posts =>
22:31:02 #      >>>>> [#<Post id: 1, title: "Title", content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.", created_at: "2011-08-16 18:56:51", updated_at: "2011-08-16 18:56:55">] <<<<<<


Disclaimer:
  This is just some little thing I toyed with and made for myself. I don't recommend that you use this in a production environment.
  Also, because it adds color to bash output, your log files will be harder to read because of the color markers bash uses.You can still read it as it
  was intended by opening it in a bash terminal.
